Because early-life economic disadvantage is associated with the lack of mastery experiences needed to build up the sense of confidence, we suggested that people who were disadvantaged in childhood would estimate their chances to succeed as lower, experience more negative emotions while solving the puzzles, and attribute their success to external and unstable factors (e.g., luck, the amount of time available to solve the puzzle).',

Please note that the amount of time available for the solution of some puzzles was too little to allow their successful solution.',

You do not need to have any prior experience with these tasks or any special knowledge. Before solving them, you will read detailed instructions explaining how to do these tasks. We estimate that the participation will take you 25 minutes in total. You can stop participating at any time. <br><br> RISKS <br> We believe that your participation in this study does not involve any physical or psychological risks. <br><br> BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY <br> The study results will help develop a new instrument that will allow us to assess individual abilities to solve tasks within a given time limit. You might find it fun to solve the tasks; however, we cannot guarantee that you personally will experience any other benefits from participating in this study.',

Because early-life economic disadvantage is associated with the lack of mastery experiences needed to build up the sense of confidence, we suggested that people who were disadvantaged in childhood would estimate their chances to succeed as lower, experience more negative emotions while solving the puzzles, and attribute their success to external and unstable factors (e.g., luck, the amount of time available to solve the puzzle).',

Please note that the amount of time available for the solution of some puzzles was too little to allow their successful solution.',

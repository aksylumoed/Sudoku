We did not reveal to you the information about this objective in advance, because this may have affected the way you responded. <br><br> In addition to the development of a new instrument, we aim to test how people with different socioeconomic backgrounds appraise their ability to successfully perform at a novel task and how they react to the situations of success and failure. Because early-life economic disadvantage is associated with the lack of mastery experiences needed to build up the sense of confidence, we suggested that people who were disadvantaged in childhood would estimate their chances to succeed as lower, experience more negative emotions while solving the puzzles, and attribute their success to external and unstable factors (e.g., luck, the amount of time available to solve the puzzle).',
       'To test this idea, we asked people with high and low economic status in childhood to fill out the psychological scales that measure confidence, appraise their ability to successfully perform at Sudoku puzzles, and solve several puzzles, either allowing sufficient time for puzzles solution or not. Please note that the amount of time available for the solution of some puzzles was too little to allow their successful solution.',

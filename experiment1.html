We did not reveal to you the information about this objective in advance, because this may have affected the way you responded. <br><br> We also aim to test how people with different socioeconomic backgrounds appraise their ability to successfully perform at tasks with different difficulty. Because early-life economic disadvantage was found to be associated with the lack of mastery experiences needed to build up the sense of confidence, we suggested that people who were disadvantaged in childhood, when faced with an ambiguous (moderately difficult) task, would estimate their chances to succeed as lower, experience more negative emotions while solving the puzzles, and attribute their success to external and unstable factors (e.g., luck, the amount of time available to solve the puzzle).',

The data will be analyzed and presented at an aggregate level. There will be no record that links the data collected from you with any personal data from which you could be identified. Once anonymized, these data may be made available to researchers via accessible data repositories and possibly used for novel purposes.',

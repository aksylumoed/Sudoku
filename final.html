The decision to join, or not to join, is up to you.',

You do not need to have any prior experience with these tasks or any special knowledge. Before solving them, you will read detailed instructions explaining how to do these tasks. We estimate that the participation will take you 10 minutes in total. You can stop participating at any time. <br><br> <b>RISKS</b> <br> We believe that your participation in this study does not involve any physical or psychological risks. <br><br> <b>BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY</b> <br> The study results will help assess individual abilities to solve tasks with different difficulty levels. You might find it fun to solve the tasks; however, we cannot guarantee that you personally will experience any other benefits from participating in this study.',
      '<b>CONFIDENTIALITY</b> <br> All information collected during the study period will be kept strictly confidential. No publications or reports from this project will include identifying information on any participant. The data will be analyzed and presented at an aggregate level. There will be no record that links the data collected from you with any personal data from which you could be identified. Once anonymized, these data may be made available to researchers via accessible data repositories and possibly used for novel purposes. <br><br> <b>YOUR RIGHTS AS A RESEARCH PARTICIPANT</b> <br> Participation in this study is voluntary. You have the right not to participate at all or to leave the study at any time. Deciding not to participate or choosing to leave the study will not result in any penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled.',

Your job is to fill the remainder of the grid with letters, respecting the three constraints mentioned earlier." ,

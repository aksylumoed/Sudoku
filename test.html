People that we invite to participate come from different backgrounds. <font color="red">In order to participate, you will need a laptop or a computer.</font>  <br> <br> Please take whatever time you need to decide whether or not you want to participate in the study. The decision to join, or not to join, is up to you.',
      '<b>WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THIS STUDY</b> <br>In this study, we will ask you to answer a few questions about yourself and complete several thinking tasks with different time limits. You do not need to have any prior experience with these tasks or any special knowledge. Before solving them, you will read detailed instructions explaining how to do these tasks. We estimate that the participation will take you 20 minutes in total. You can stop participating at any time. <br><br> Because we want to ensure that different groups of people are represented in the study, we will ask you a couple of questions to assess whether you are still eligible to participate. If you do not qualify for this study, you will not be able to participate.',
      '<b>RISKS</b> <br>We believe that your participation in this study does not involve any physical risks. However, some of the questions are sensitive (questions related to your childhood experiences) and might make some people uncomfortable. If answering these questions makes you uncomfortable, feel free to close the survey now or at any point during the survey.<br><br> <b>BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY</b> <br> The study results will help assess individual abilities to solve tasks with different difficulty levels. You might find it fun to solve the tasks; however, we cannot guarantee that you personally will experience any other benefits from participating in this study.',
      '<b>CONFIDENTIALITY</b> <br> All information collected during the study period will be kept strictly confidential. No publications or reports from this project will include identifying information on any participant. The data will be analyzed and presented at an aggregate level. There will be no record that links the data collected from you with any personal data from which you could be identified. Once anonymized, these data may be made available to researchers via accessible data repositories and possibly used for novel purposes. <br><br> <b>YOUR RIGHTS AS A RESEARCH PARTICIPANT</b> <br> Participation in this study is voluntary. You have the right not to participate at all or to leave the study at any time. Deciding not to participate or choosing to leave the study will not result in any penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled.',
      '<b>CONTACTS FOR QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS</b> <br> If you have any questions or would like to receive additional information about the study, you may contact Olga Poluektova, Ph.D. Fellow at Bremen Graduate School of Social Sciences (BIGSSS) at opoluektova@bigsss-bremen.de. If you have any concerns about the study or your rights as a research participant, you may contact BIGSSS Ethics Committee at ethics@bigsss-bremen.de.'
